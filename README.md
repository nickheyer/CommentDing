# CommentDing!
A selenium-based stream message notification system!

Simply install via "CommentDing!_Setup.exe".
Copy and paste your youtube stream url into the command prompt (twitch will eventually be implemented as well). The notification is a moderate volume "bell". 
You can turn this down or up via Window's 'volume mixer', just right click your volume icon, go to volume mixer, then go to CommentDing!.

The bell will ring once to let you know that it's initiated, and every (however many seconds you set for the delay) seconds it will check chat again. If there is a new message when chat is checked, the bell shall ring once more!
